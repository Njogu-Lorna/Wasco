            <strong> Water Companies Sports Organization (WASCO) was originally formed as a Sports 
            Association (WASCA) in January 2010 by Employees of Water Companies operating in Kenya, 
            before converting to a Sports Organization in October 2015 in line with the Sports Act 2013.
            The main purpose of the Organization is to provide a Forum for water companies’ employees to 
            interact while competing in sports and cultural activities. They share their experiences, benchmark 
            as well as create network mechanism among themselves and other stakeholders in attendance
            The Organization was officially launched on 20th August 2010 giving it the mandate to plan 
            and organize Annual Water Companies’ employees’ Sports and Cultural Competition in Kenya. 
            WASCO brings together Water Companies involved in the delivery of water and sanitation 
            services across the country with 29 Counties represented. The member Companies must be 
            registered members of WASPA (Water Service Provides Association).</strong>

              </div>
              <p> The Organization held its inaugural Games from 22th to 24th of September 2010; in Thika, 
                hosted by Thika Water and Sewerage Co. Ltd. There were 21 member companies participating, 
                with excess of 500 participants and over 5,000 spectators over the three day period, thereby 
                being quite successful for such a young Organization. The Organization has since then held five 
                more Annual Events in Mombasa, (2011) Nakuru, (2012), Nairobi (2013), Eldoret (2014) and 
                Machakos (2015), all hosted by the respective Water Service Providers operating within these 
                townships, with the number of Membership and Participants having increased many folds over 
                the years.

              <p>
                The Games by WASCO have created forum for interaction and exposure to the employees of 
                the water sector. This has seen more benchmarking visits among the member companies with a 
                view of sharing experiences thus improving service delivery.

                It has also exposed certain teams from member companies to National and International 
                tournaments e.g Nairobi Water Company and Garissa Water Companies are good examples 
                whose teams have been taking active part in National and International tournaments in 
                discipliners such as Volleyball, Netball, Handball etc. Other teams also take active part in 
                regional tournaments organized by related Sports Federations, thus making healthy workforce 
                at work places.

              <p>
                There has been a general improvement of performances in the water sector. Though this might 
                not be directly attributed to the WASCO games, there is general attributes that the interactions 
                and sharing experiences by the thousands of the employees participating, has played significant 
                role.
                Also the determination to ensure that revenue base is enhanced at the respective member 
                companies, not only to meet sports related expenses, but also to sustain operations of their 
                companies cannot be over emphasized, as the employees are quite aware of the Annual 
                Appraisals and reporting in the <strong>IMPACT: A Performance Review of Kenya’s Water Services 
                Sector by WASREB.</strong>

          <h2>Our <strong>Future Plans</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Wasco is to develop a <strong>5 year Strategic Plan</strong> that would address the above challenges as 
            well as create suitable platform on how best the sports in the water sector can be made more 
            competitive and support the development of the youths being recruited in the water sector, 
            and more so to expose them to world class teams that may propel them to greater heights and 
            realize their sporting potentials
            WASCO will also ensure its participants take part in the national teams selection competitions e.g 
            Athletics, Olympics etc, also encourage the WASCO teams to enrol in the regional tournaments 
            so as to keep players active throughout the year rather than to wait for the Annual WASCO 
            games.
